Industrial Workers of the World Freelance Journalists Union members in the United States have collectively agreed to strike on June 19, also known as Juneteenth, an annual holiday commemorating the freeing of enslaved Black people at the end of the US Civil War.

On June 19, we will refrain from engaging in any sort of commissioned labor that is unrelated to the ongoing Black Lives Matter uprisings and, instead, participate in local BLM actions or provide support remotely. Acknowledging that many of our Black Fellow Workers are receiving more general assignments ostensibly unrelated to — yet inspired by — the ongoing uprisings, we are considering those BLM-related as well and thus exempt from the strike. We will also be continuing other unpaid journalistic work amplifying actions, such as social media coverage.

We ask Fellow Workers in other sections of the IWW, and workers more generally, to consider advocating for strikes, sick-outs, or similar labor-withholding actions on June 19. We also ask other, non-labor-related organizations to consider calling for a “Day of Action” or similar event on June 19 to encourage their members to get involved, however possible, in local BLM actions.

An Injury to One is an Injury to All!
