title: Support your local Black Lives Matter uprising
---
There are an unprecedented number of uprisings related to the Black Lives Matter movement currently occurring throughout the United States. The Industrial Workers of the World was founded on a commitment to racial justice in 1905, and the IWW Freelance Journalists Union continues to support the working class in its struggle for that justice. Our slogan is: An Injury to One is an Injury to All.

If you are interested in getting involved in local actions, supporting community self-defense resources such as bail funds, etc., we encourage you to contact your local IWW branch to learn more about how to do so in your area. A full directory of IWW branches in the United States can be found here: [iww.org/directory](https://iww.org/directory)

If this is the first time that you are contacting your local IWW branch, they may want some confirmation of your standing in the union for security purposes. If so, please ask them to contact the IWW FJU at [freelancejournalists@iww.org](mailto:freelancejournalists@iww.org).

Also, we've heard, repeatedly, of journalists reporting from these actions being attacked, arrested, or otherwise prevented from covering these historic events. If you are in need of any support — be it professional, legal, or even emotional — please contact us at [freelancejournalists@iww.org](mailto:freelancejournalists@iww.org).

To paraphrase the preamble to the IWW's Constitution: We are building the new world within the shell of the old.
