1. If a comrade asks you to stop filming them, stop filming them. Generally speaking, our cameras should be trained on law enforcement and reactionaries, not to unintentionally incriminate comrades.
2. Be cognizant of where and when is an appropriate time to livestream. Law enforcement can watch livestreams for real-time information, and you may be unwittingly helping them repress comrades.
3. Ask for permission to film comrades and get their consent before publishing. If possible, get permission from organizers prior to the action.
4. If you accidentally capture comrades on film, obscure their faces, tattoos, and all other identifying characteristics before publishing. Minimize the need for this by focusing on comradesâ€™ legs and backs, if they are in the frame at all.
5. Lock your devices with alpha-numeric passcodes. Law enforcement may be able to force you to unlock devices with your face or fingerprint.
6. While it may be valuable to film police violence, that footage does not necessarily need to be published immediately. Make the safety of comrades your priority.
7. Do not voluntarily give up footage to law enforcement. Ask them for a subpoena, then contact us at [freelancejournalists@iww.org](freelancejournalists@iww.org).
