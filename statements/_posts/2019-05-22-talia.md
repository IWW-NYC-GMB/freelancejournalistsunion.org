title: Statement of support for Talia Jane
---
On May 5, IWW Freelance Journalists Union member Talia Jane reported Mike Rosenberg of *The Seattle Times* for sexual harassment via Twitter. Jane notified *The Seattle Times*, which suspended Rosenberg pending an investigation. For exposing a man who made inappropriate sexual comments to a colleague, Jane has become the target of online harassment and trolling. She has also given a number of other women the courage to come forward with their own stories of sexual harassment at work â€” once again demonstrating the ubiquity of predatory behavior.

Freelancing is hard enough without professional acquaintances abusing the power imbalance inherent between established journalists and young writers. The IWW Freelance Journalists Union unequivocally stands with Talia Jane against sexual harassment, misogyny, and patriarchy.
