title: In solidarity with Talia Jane and all other journalists harassed by NYPD
---
On the evening of Friday, February 12, Talia Jane, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World Freelance Journalists Union, was arrested by officers of the New York Police Department while documenting a demonstration against policing. In the course of Jane’s arrest, officers confiscated her union-issued press pass, which they refused to return even after she was released.

The IWW FJU is committed to the motto of the Industrial Workers of the World: An injury to one is an injury to all. As such, the IWW FJU condemns the arrest of Jane and the harassment of all other journalists by the NYPD in the strongest possible terms — as acts of police intimidation and de facto censorship of the press. Journalists from across the United States are brutalized, detained, and arrested for shining a light on the violence that police and policing do to communities.

While Jane has obtained legal representation and is not currently in need of any other public support at this time, the IWW FJU would like to reiterate its solidarity with her and all other journalists who risk their freedom and well-being to continue documenting the actions of police. As journalists, we will not be intimidated. We will continue to record and report on the corrupt systems of power that brutalize our communities every day.
