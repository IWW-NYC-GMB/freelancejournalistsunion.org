In light of Donald Trump’s failed re-election campaign, the assortment of fascists that he has drawn support from — such as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, American Guard, and Patriot Prayer — continue terrorizing their opponents with new desperation. While some critics believe that Trump’s electoral defeat signals the end of the fascist threat, the violence perpetrated against residents and visitors in Washington D.C. this past weekend illustrates the danger of conceding the streets to forces of nationalist violence and virulent bigotry.

As our slogan is "An Injury to One is an Injury to All," the Industrial Workers of the World is committed to mass anti-fascism and community self-defense, and the IWW Freelance Journalists Union supports the struggle against all proponents of oppression and discrimination.

In particular, fascists have targeted journalists for attack, harassment, and other abuse for simply doing their jobs documenting, analyzing, and sharing information from the frontlines. We stand in solidarity with the many journalists who put their lives and well-being on the line to continue to provide important coverage of these events as they occur. If you are in need of any support — be it professional, legal, or even emotional — please contact us at [freelancejournalists@iww.org](mailto:freelancejournalists@iww.org).

If you are interested in getting involved in anti-fascist actions, supporting community self-defense resources such as bail funds, etc., we encourage you to contact your local IWW branch to learn more about how to do so in your area. A full directory of IWW branches in the United States can be found here: [iww.org/directory](https://iww.org/directory)

To echo the call to action against fascists of an earlier generation, we say: _¡No pasarán!_
